Before a program is executed, the source code of a program needs to be compiled. If the program has compile errors, the source code needs to be modified to fix the problem, then recompile it. Text editor and IDEs can be used to modify the source code. The compiled Java source code file is called bytecode. This is a low level language meaning unlike high level language it is often cryptic and not human readable. The CPU does not understand a high level language like our source code, instead it must be compiled into a low level language. 

The bytecode is similar to machine instructions but is architecture natural and can run on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine(JVM). This is the virtual machine that interprets Java bytecode. To execute a Java program is to run the program’s bytecode. This can be executed on any platform with a JVM installed on it. This translates the instructions in bytecode one line at a time rather than the  whole program as a single unit. Each step is executed immediately after it is translated.
