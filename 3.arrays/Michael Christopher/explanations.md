For this assignment, i use arraylist and the reason why i use arraylist and not array is because the program has a function to add and delete items in the arraylist (add stationery stock and buy stationery) which can't be done using normal arrays because array are static and once the size are determined, it cannot be edited meanwhile arraylist are dynamic and the sizes are re-sizeable.
